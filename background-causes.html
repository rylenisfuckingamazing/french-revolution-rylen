        <h2>Main Reasons for the Start of the French Revolution:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Social Inequality (unfair treatment):</strong> 
                The French society was divided into three estates:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First Estate:</strong> Clergy (people who work for the church) (1% of the population)</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Estate:</strong> Nobility (wealthy landowners) (2% of the population)</li>
                    <li><strong>Third Estate:</strong> Commoners (ordinary people) (97% of the population), which included peasants (farmers), urban workers (people who live in cities), and the bourgeoisie (middle class). They were burdened by heavy taxes while the first two estates enjoyed privileges (special rights).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Economic Hardship (financial problems):</strong> 
                France faced severe financial difficulties due to costly wars (expensive battles), including support for the American Revolution (the war for American independence). Bad harvests (poor crop yields) in the late 1780s led to food shortages (lack of food), rising bread prices, and widespread hunger.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Enlightenment Ideas:</strong> 
                Philosophers (thinkers) like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu promoted ideas of liberty (freedom), equality (fairness), and fraternity (brotherhood), inspiring the populace (the people) to challenge the monarchy (the king and his rule) and the existing social order.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Weak Leadership:</strong> 
                King Louis XVI was seen as indecisive (unable to make decisions) and ineffective (not successful). His failure to address the financial crisis and reform the taxation system deepened public discontent (unhappiness).
